**# Customer Support Training Data Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains the code and analysis for performing customer support training data analysis using the Customer Support Training Data available on Kaggle. The analysis aims to gain insights into customer support interactions and improve customer service strategies.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is the [Customer Support Training Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/talaviyabhavik/customer-support-training-data) available on Kaggle. It consists of customer support interactions, including text messages and corresponding labels indicating the category of each interaction.

### Dataset Details
- **File Format:** CSV
- **Columns:**
  - **Text:** Textual content of the customer support interaction.
  - **Label:** Category label indicating the type or topic of the interaction.

## Model Selection: Gemma
For this analysis, we have chosen to use the Gemma model. Gemma has shown better performance compared to other models on similar tasks and possesses a higher token count, making it suitable for handling the complexities and nuances of customer support text data.

### Why Gemma?
- **Performance:** Gemma has demonstrated superior performance in various natural language processing tasks, including text classification and sentiment analysis.
- **High Token Count:** With a higher token count, Gemma can capture more intricate patterns and nuances in the text data, leading to improved performance and accuracy.
- **Robustness:** Gemma's robust architecture ensures stability and reliability, even when dealing with noisy or unstructured text data.

## Analysis
The analysis involves preprocessing the text data, training the Gemma model on the labeled customer support interactions, and evaluating its performance on various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Comparative Analysis: LLAMA 2 vs. Gemma
For a comprehensive comparison, a photo illustrating the performance comparison between LLAMA 2 and Gemma can be added to the repository. This comparison will provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each model, aiding in informed decision-making for model selection and deployment.

### Performance Metrics:
- **Accuracy:** The percentage of correctly classified customer support interactions.
- **Precision:** The proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions made by the model.
- **Recall:** The proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual positive instances in the dataset.
- **F1-score:** The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two metrics.

## Conclusion
The analysis aims to provide valuable insights into customer support interactions and enhance customer service strategies using state-of-the-art natural language processing techniques. By leveraging the Gemma model and conducting a comparative analysis, we can identify the most suitable approach for addressing customer support challenges effectively.
